            <p>
            This guide covers how to publish your Story Synth game on its own website so that anyone can create a session and play. You should already be familiar with the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A676dhZP_4KPPhHGZ3L4ngVvo5pr3c7LQIcUD9Wgi6Y/edit?usp=sharing">How to Playtest</a> guide.
            </p>
            <p>
            Visit <a href="http://monster.diegeticgames.com/">Dawn of the Monster Invasion</a> for example of a published game that runs on Story Synth.
            </p>
            <p>
            In order to publish with Story Synth, you need some familiarity with coding and the command line. You’ll mostly be copying and pasting where instructed and occasionally commenting out parts of the codebase that you don’t need. You’ll also need to create a Firebase account. Familiarity with Git and Github is encouraged but not necessary.
            </p>
            <h2>Step one: run Story Synth on your machine</h2>
            
            
            <p>
            Follow the instructions in the README at the <a href="https://github.com/randylubin/Story-Synth">Story Synth Github Repo</a>. I recommend using a modern code editor like <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
            High level overview:
            </p>
            <ol>
            
            <li>Install Node.js and npm
            
            <li>Download the Story Synth codebase from GitHub
            
            <li>Install the dependencies with npm
            
            <li>Create a Firebase account and project
            
            <li>Add your Firebase credentials to the app
            
            <li>Run the app with <code>npm run serve</code>
            </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
            Then you’ll be able to view the site at <a href="http://localhost:8080/">localhost:8080</a>
            </p>
            <h2>Step two: remove unnecessary code</h2>
            
            
            <p>
            There’s plenty of code that’s necessary for the playtest version but not for the published version.
            </p>

            <p>
            There are comments in the code <code>&lt;!-- Remove for published version --></code> or <code>// Remove for published version</code> to help you easily identify where they are. You can comment out those blocks of code or delete them entirely.
            </p>
            <h3>In App.vue</h3>
            
            
            <p>
            Remove any unused components. You’ll likely use only one of the game types and can remove the others from the template at the top, the import, and the components list.
            </p>
            <h3>In RoomPicker.vue</h3>
            
            
            <p>
            Remove and replace the headers and about section of the app. Then, remove the format and sheet fields from the form.
            </p>
            <h3>The documentation</h3>
            
            
            <p>
            Delete the /public/about folder which contains the Story Synth documentation (which you’re reading right now).
            </p>
            <h2>Step three: hardcode the game type and Google Sheet link</h2>
            
            
            <p>
            Next, we need to set some extra defaults so that Story Synth always uses your game template and spreadsheet.
            </p>
            <p>
            Hardcode the template type into the router-link in RoomPicker.vue. For example it might look like <code>&lt;router-link :to="{path: '/' + formatToURL(“Shuffled”, gSheetID, roomID)}"></code>
            </p>
            <p>
            Hardcode your Google Sheet URL into your game’s .vue file. In the function fetchAndCleanSheetData, set the variable getURL equal to your Google Spreadsheet link.
            </p>
            <h2>Step four: update metadata and assets</h2>
            
            
            <p>
            You’ll want to update metadata in a few locations:
            </p>
            <ul>
            
            <li>The meta-title and meta-description in /public/index.html
            
            <li>The favicon.ico
            
            <li>The readme
            </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Step five: publish to Firebase Hosting</h2>
            
            
            <p>
            When you’re ready to publish the app, there are two key steps:
            </p>
            <p>
            Use <code>npm run build</code> to compile the code into the <code>/dist</code> folder.
            </p>
            <p>
            Use <code>firebase deploy --only hosting</code> to push the site live via Firebase Hosting.
            </p>
            <p>
            If you don’t want to use Firebase hosting, you can also use GitHub pages or host on your own server.
            </p>
            <p>
            Firebase Hosting automatically shares your app at projectname.web.app but you can also use a custom domain or subdomain (e.g. storysynth.org, monster.diegeticgames.com). You can set up custom domains from the Firebase Console.
            </p>
            <p>
            At this point your site should be live on the web and shareable - congrats!
            </p>
            <h2>Optional customization</h2>
            
            
            <p>
            While the above steps are all that’s needed to publish a Story Synth app, there plenty more customization that you can do.
            </p>
            <h4>Custom title and info</h4>
            
            
            <p>
            The homepage of your app lives in the RoomPicker.vue file. If you want to add a custom title or other custom info (game length, player count, etc), this is the best place to add it.
            </p>
            <h4>Custom style</h4>
            
            
            <p>
            Each Vue file (e.g. App.vue, RoomPicker.vue, Monster.vue) has its own style section at the bottom of the file. Custom CSS on App.vue will appear on all pages but if you only want to affect one page, then add it to just that page in the &lt;style scoped> section.
            </p>
            <h4>Hardcode game content</h4>
            
            
            <p>
            When you’re done iterating on your games content, you can hardcode it directly into the app. This lets you skip the Axios API call to Google Sheets which should speed up app performance and improve reliability.
            </p>
            <p>
            To hardcode your game content follow, these steps:
            </p>
            <ol>
            
            <li>Download your Google Sheet as a CSV: <b>File > Download > Comma-separated values</b>
            
            <li>Convert the .csv file to JSON via <a href="https://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-json.htm">Convert CSV</a>
            
            <li>Remove Axios API call in fetchAndCleanSheetData()
            
            <li>In fetchAndCleanSheetData(), set this.gSheet equal to the JSON object from Convert CSV
            </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Next steps</h2>
            
            
            <p>
            If you’ve followed these instructions, you now have a live version of your game that anyone can play.
