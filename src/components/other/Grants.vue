          <h3>Program Details</h3>
          <div>
            <p>The microgrants are for designers from marginalized backgrounds to create new games on Story Synth that take advantage of web monetization.</p>

            <p>The microgrants come with the following:</p>
            <ul>              
              <li>$300 to each grant recipient (up to 100 recipients) to create a game in a 6 month window</li>
              <li>Administrative support from the Big Bad Con grants administrators</li>
              <li>Story Synth technical and design support from Randy Lubin</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The microgrant program is being run by the wonderful folks at Big Bad Con. Learn more about the application process and apply on <a href="https://www.bigbadcon.com/story-synth-microgrants/">Big Bad Con's site</a>.</p>

          <h3>More About Web Monetization</h3>

          <p>The funds for this program are provided by <a href="https://www.grantfortheweb.org/">Grant for the Web</a>, a non-profit seeking to boost open, fair, and inclusive standards and innovation in <a href="https://webmonetization.org/">Web Monetization</a> - how content creators earn income online.</p>

          <p>The Web Monetization standard allows sites to know if a site visitor is sending micropayments and the site can then enable content or functionality for that user. An early example of this is <a href="https://coil.com/">Coil</a>, a browser extension where a user can subscribe for $5.00 per month and that money is shared among the sites that the user visits, based on time spent.</p>

          <p>In addition to the $300 grant award, you will also receive proceeds generated by your game through micropayments. They may be just pennies here and there, but as more people play they will add up.</p>

          <p>Story Synth currenty has a basic implementation of web monetization via the monetization <a href="https://docs.storysynth.org/guide/options.html">custom option</a>. Over the next few months, we'll be adding new monetization related functionality to Story Synth, including the ability to restrict some or all of your game to groups of players using web monetization. Stay tuned for more details.</p>
