          <h2>Overview</h2>


          <p>
          Story Synth is a platform for developing, playtesting, and publishing lightweight storytelling games on the web. The mission is to lower the barrier to playtesting games online and encourage a flourishing of new designs.
          </p>
          <p>
          There are a few key features:
          </p>
          <ul>

          <li>Designers can create their game in an Google Spreadsheet and can playtest by pasting the link into Story Synth – no coding knowledge needed.

          <li>Story Synth games take place in “Rooms” where content is synchronized for everyone in the same Room. In other words, everybody at the same URL automatically sees the same content.

          <li>There are multiple templates for different types of games and, if you’re comfortable coding, you can add your own games
          </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          You can see the templates in action (with placeholder content) at <a href="https://storysynth.org/">storysynth.org</a>. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Visit <a href="http://monster.diegeticgames.com/">Dawn of the Monster Invasion</a> for example of a published game that runs on Story Synth.
          </p>
          <p>
          Check out the <a href="https://github.com/randylubin/Story-Synth">repository on GitHub</a> to explore and download the codebase.
          </p>
          <h2>Use cases and guides</h2>


          <p>
          Story Synth is for game designers with one of three use cases:
          </p>
          <ol>

          <li>Playtesting a game that uses one of the existing templates (no coding needed)

          <li>Publishing a game that uses one of the existing templates, on their own website, so that others can easily play it (some, simple coding needed)

          <li>Extending one one of the templates or creating their own template, to add mechanics that suit their game (serious coding needed)
          </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
          Here are guides for each of the use cases:
          </p>
          <ol>

          <li><a href="/about/playtest.html">How to Playtest with Story Synth</a>

          <li><a href="/about/publish.html">How to Publish with Story Synth</a>

          <li><a href="/about/extend.html">How to Extend Story Synth</a>
          </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
          I’m planning to elaborate on these guides so please reach out with any questions or if anything is unclear.
          </p>
          <h2>Available templates</h2>


          <p>
          Story Synth currently has four different game templates you can use. Here’s an overview of each template, its influences, and a link to the template spreadsheet.
          </p>
          <h3>Shuffled</h3>


          <p>
          <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N5eeyKTVWo5QeGcUV_zYtwtR0DikJCcvcj6w69UkC1w/edit?usp=sharing">Shuffled Template Spreadsheet</a>
          </p>
          <p>
          This template is inspired by Alex Robert’s game <em>For the Queen</em> (<a href="https://www.evilhat.com/home/for-the-queen/">buy</a>) (<a href="https://forthequeengame.com/srd">SRD</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
          Games following this template have:
          </p>
          <ul>

          <li>A series of instructions, spread over short cards that appear in a fixed order

          <li>A number of storytelling prompts that are shuffled in order

          <li>A final card that brings the game to a close, which is always the last card

          <li>An <a href="http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg">x-card</a> for safety
          </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          Unlike <em>For the Queen</em>, there are no Queen cards to choose from and the final card is always last, rather than shuffled into the deck.
          </p>
          <p>
          The broader format of ordered instructions followed by random prompts lends itself to a wide variety of games that stray far from <em>For the Queen</em>.
          </p>
          <h3>Timed</h3>


          <p>
          <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yq2AKwaYL1uZrCnEfwgSpC0SPkQAZqnCdjNxH_pm018/edit?usp=sharing">Timed Template Spreadsheet</a>
          </p>
          <p>
          This template is inspired by Jason Morningstar’s game <em>Find/Fix/Finish</em> (<a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/find-fix-finish-35788333">buy</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
          This game has a shared timer and private prompts are sent to players at specific times. Players can pause, unpause, and restart the game at any point.
          </p>
          <p>
          Unlike <em>Find/Fix/Finish</em>, there aren’t any decision points where a player can choose from different options and which result in different content later. There also isn’t space for links to reference material, though you could include them in the prompts.
          </p>
          <h3>Secrets</h3>


          <p>
          <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JwMF02DSxNKtjHp6u-wyznSs-iEG_3DpOobgc17I16o/edit?usp=sharing">Secrets Template Spreadsheet</a>
          </p>
          <p>
          This template is similar to the Timed template but prompts are tied to each turn instead of a timer and turns are manually advanced.
          </p>
          <p>
          In each turn, each player will receive one public prompt (seen by all) and one private prompt (seen only by them).
          </p>
          <h3>Monster</h3>


          <p>
          <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NgNHy7Qe1R8KhGR2cOmJwL2aOl2tocBemW2HIAKjrvI/edit?usp=sharing">Monster Template Spreadsheet</a>
          </p>
          <p>
          This template is inspired by Randy Lubin’s game <em>Dawn of the Monster Invasion</em> (<a href="http://monster.diegeticgames.com/">play online</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
          This template has:
          </p>
          <ul>

          <li>A series of ordered instructions at the beginning of the game

          <li>A series of rounds, with each round containing several prompts to choose from

          <li>The prompts are fixed to the specific rounds (i.e. not random) and players will face the same options each playthrough
          </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Technology used</h2>


          <p>
          Story Synth uses:
          </p>
          <ul>

          <li><a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> for the frontend framework

          <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> for syncing game state, presence, and website hosting

          <li><a href="https://vuefire.vuejs.org/">VueFire</a> to sync Firebase and Vue

          <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios">Axios</a> to fetch data from Google Sheets

          <li><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> for the design framework
          </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          This means Story Synth is serverless and completely free at moderate usage.
          </p>
          <h2>Licensing</h2>


          <p>
          Story Synth is open source and published under the extremely permissive <a href="https://github.com/randylubin/Story-Synth/blob/master/LICENSE">MIT license</a>, meaning you can do almost whatever you want with it.
          </p>
          <p>
          There’s no need to cite Story Synth in your game or on your webpage, though credit is always welcome!
